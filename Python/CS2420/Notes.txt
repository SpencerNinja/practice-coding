    Example: plate dispenser at buffet
    LIFO = last in first out
    FILO = first in last out

    ADT
    - push         (Big-O order 1) 
    - pop          (Big-O order 1) 
    - top          (Big-O order 1) 
    - IsEmpty      (Big-O order 1) 

    Details
    - class Stack
    def __init__(self):
        self.A = []
    def push(self, item):
        self.A.append(item)

- Queue 
    Example: checkout line in store
    FIFO = first in first out

    ADT
    - enqueue       (Big-O order 1) 
    - dequeue       (Big-O order N) 
    - front         (Big-O order 1)

    Linked Lists
    - Why linked lists instead of Python lists?
        1. Linked lists work with fragmented memory
            - simply changes the reference at the end of one part to skip over the deleted part of memory.
        2. Easier to insert and delete 


    self.mFirst (node)
        - mItem|mNext
        - Bob|->Jane  Jane|none     
        # check for posted code example (lls2.pyw) 11:30
        n = node = mItem|mNext
        n.mItem
        n.mNext
