# Create the following functions in your main.py file. You will need to also import and use your CaloricBalance class from caloric_balance.py.

# Because of the user input and output, not all functions are easily tested with unit tests. Be sure to test these functions by running your program and observing the correct behavior.

If the user enters a non-number or a number less than or equal to zero it should prompt them again. To accomplish this you might consider using a try/except clause  which allows you to try an execute some code(convert userâ€™s input to a float) and recover if it fails.
