# We are not providing unittests for main.py because it is too difficult to test a program this dynamic, we will have to rely on Acceptance Testing to verify it works as expected. It is up to you to figure out how to finish the game using the player class. Here is a list of functions that might be useful to you. You are not required to create any of them. As you work on this if you see any other functions that might be useful to other students feel free to suggest them.

                print("Please enter a number greater than zero.")
        except:
            print("Please enter a number.")

# getUserInt - Similar to getUserFloat from the previous 2 assignments but instead of casting the user input to a float, cast it to an int

def getUserString(string):
    reply = input(string).strip()
    # while len(reply) == 0:
        # reply = input(string).strip()
    return reply
# getUserString - Similar to getUserString from previous assignments, except an empty string should be ok(so a user can skip their turn)

main()
# Your file should consist of of main() function which is called to execute your program.

# Pass-off instructions
# To pass off this assignment you need to show your completed program to the lab assistants.
# Show them your player.py and main.py code
# Run test_all.py - All tests MUST pass!
# Run main.py
# The lab assistants may have additional tests they want you to run.
# Upload your player.py and main.py files to canvas(you may zip them), please add a comment to the top of the files with your name and time your class meets.
